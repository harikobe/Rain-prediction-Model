# Rain Prediction Model

## Description

This repository contains the code and data for building a logistic regression model to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data. The dataset includes features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, etc., along with the target variable indicating whether it rained the following day. The code includes data preprocessing steps, model training using logistic regression, evaluation metrics calculation, and model deployment instructions.

### Contents

- `weather_prediction_logistic_regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
- `data/`: Folder containing the historical weather data CSV file.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and information about the dataset.
